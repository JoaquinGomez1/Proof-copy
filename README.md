Converting a website layout image to a functional website

Original website: https://useproof.com/ (I'm not related in anyway with this company)

Note: When I started making this webpage, I decided to clone the exact layout of an already existing one. Instead of designing one on my own, I believe this is the best way for me to improve right now. However, after a quick search, I found the original website URL and I considered to include it in this readme file. It's also important to remark that all of the images used on the project are from their website as well.
