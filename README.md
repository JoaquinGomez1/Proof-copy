Converting a website layout image to a functional website

Original website: https://useproof.com/ (I'm not related in anyway with this company)

Note: When I started making this page I decided to clone the exact layout of an already existing website instead of trying to design one on my own since I believe that is probably the best way for me right now to improve. However since I started the project I found the original website url and I believe it is important that I include it in this readme file. 
 It's also important to remark that all of the images used on my project are (as it is evident) from their website aswell.
